DISCLAIMER:
this class can access/delete/create your drive account by providing a credentials file >not< your mail and PW of course
You have to revise this class to make sure it doesn't do any illegal things to your data >> it's really safe don't worry :)
********************************
drive manager: connects with drive api on colab which have very high speed network :D 30 MBps :D
You need credentials files from drive api
This can upload and download files from your drive and save check points while training on Colab efficiently and resume your training on any other machine :3

IMPORTANT these files are confidential don't share them or they have control on your drive account !
********************************
To use this:
1.just create a folder on your drive and replace personal_dfolder
you need to know base_download_dfolder is owned my mohammed.a.elkomy and you can access all of its public experiments (the code can access it and you can resume from my experiments :D)

2.obtain your credential file/files and name them as cred* for example cred1.txt cred_mohammed.txt or any thing cred*.txt
3.you can use multiple credentials files = multiple drive accounts which matches cred*
4.it will automatically push your checkpoints regularly to your personal_dfolder and it can if needed download experiments from base_download_dfolder
